Solution: Removed unnecessary variables from CMakeLists.txt or ensured they were correctly specified.
Compilation Errors Related to MoveIt

Error: no matching function for call to ‘moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface::MoveGroupInterface(PickAndPlace*, const char [12])’
Details: The code attempted to initialize MoveGroupInterface with incorrect arguments, leading to compilation errors.
Solution: Corrected the constructor parameters to match the expected arguments of MoveGroupInterface.
Package Dependency Errors
