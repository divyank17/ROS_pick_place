# Pick and Place Robot with MoveIt and ROS 2

## Overview

This project showcases a robotic pick-and-place operation using MoveIt and ROS 2. It demonstrates how to control a robot arm to pick up an object from one location and place it at another using MoveItâ€™s planning capabilities.

## Features

- Robot arm manipulation using MoveIt.
- ROS 2 integration for robotic control and node management.
- Ability to move objects between specified locations.
